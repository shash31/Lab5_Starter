1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
- No, I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application as that is a very complex task which involves many operations and your entire application and all of its components working together properly without bugs.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
- I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application as this is a much smaller and more specific component of the entire application which can be tested easily.
